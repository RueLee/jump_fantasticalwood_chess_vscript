# jump_fantasticalwood Chess VScript
A vscript from my jump map jump_fantasticalwood. To download the map, see: https://jump.tf/forum/index.php?topic=3449.0

### Script bugs and notices
This algorithm may include any glitches/bugs since I may have had an error in my code or due to a TF2 update. If you do end up finding one, please use the "Issues" tab and I'll be happy to take a look.

Keep in mind that the following mechanics have not yet been added to the script:
- Draw by Threefold Repetition (See [this link](https://www.chess.com/terms/threefold-repetition-chess) for definition)
- Draw by Insufficient Material
- Chess Timer
